A layered request-processing gateway implementing core reliability patterns used in distributed systems to maintain stability under failure, overload, and duplicate conditions.
Purpose

Real-world backend systems must operate safely despite unreliable dependencies, high traffic, and repeated requests.
This project models a resilience-first gateway that applies multiple defensive mechanisms before executing a request.

The goal is to demonstrate how layered reliability patterns work together to preserve system stability.
